                <p>
                    We want to help people with disabilities to reach main
                    stream education and have employment opportunities.
                    Approximately 1% of the Karnataka population consist of
                    children with special needs. This aggregates to a
                    whopping 5 lakh children and out of this, the survey
                    indicates that only 1% of the children with special needs
                    go to school and complete secondary education. Rest 99%
                    of the children with special needs never attend school and
                    remain illiterate thus leading to increased dependency on
                    others for livelihood. Our aim is to ensure the remaining
                    99% children also get the basic training and become
                    ready to go to a mainstream school.

                            Do we have existing government schemes
                            to support such causes? How is SRP different?

                    <p>
                        Yes, there are a number of government schemes
                        supporting such causes. However, the schemes are not
                        addressing the problem in a holistic manner and most of
                        the schemes work in silos. Hence to solve it in a holistic
                        manner, we have designed the

                        government to address the issue of basic education for
                        children with special needs.

                        To address this problem, Fourth Wave Foundation has been working with the Karnataka government on a program
                        named as “School Readiness Program - SRP”. This program runs from centers located in government selected locations
                        providing –

                        The Mini SRP centers are leaner versions of main SRP Centers. Each Mini SRP will have one skilled teacher and
                        physiotherapist to train children with special needs, along with a helper to assist these two main staff. Along with that,
                        the center will also have basic health infrastructure needed for providing mobility and self-sustenance skills to children
                        with special needs.

                        Currently, the SRP centers are closed. The teachers and physiotherapist are visiting the children's home for providing
                        the training and physiotherapy sessions. We are planning to utilize this time for creating Mini -SRP centers; so that the
                        centre is operational for children as soon as pandemic comes under control.
